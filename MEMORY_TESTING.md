# TinyOS Memory Testing Suite

## Overview

TinyOS now includes a comprehensive memory testing suite that thoroughly validates the memory management system. The testing covers allocation, deallocation, boundary conditions, stress testing, and corruption detection.

## Memory Test Commands

### Basic Memory Commands
- **x/X** - Run basic memory test (5 blocks allocation/deallocation)
- **m/M** - Show detailed memory statistics
- **g/G** - Run memory corruption check
- **r/R** - Defragment memory

### Comprehensive Testing
- **z/Z** - **NEW!** Run comprehensive memory test suite (all tests)
- **c/C** - System health check (includes enhanced memory tests)

## Test Suite Details

### 1. Basic Memory Test (`run_memory_test`)
**Purpose**: Validate fundamental allocation and deallocation
**Actions**:
- Allocates 5 blocks sequentially
- Writes unique test patterns (0xDEADBEEF + index)
- Verifies data integrity
- Frees all blocks
- Confirms return to initial state

**Validates**: Basic allocation, data integrity, proper cleanup

### 2. Memory Stress Test (`run_stress_test`)
**Purpose**: Test system under heavy memory usage
**Actions**:
- Allocates 50 blocks with unique patterns
- Verifies all data is intact
- Frees every other block (creates fragmentation)
- Allocates new blocks in fragmented space
- Verifies old data remains uncorrupted
- Cleans up all allocations

**Validates**: Large-scale allocation, fragmentation handling, data persistence

### 3. Boundary Test (`run_boundary_test`)
**Purpose**: Validate memory boundaries and alignment
**Actions**:
- Allocates a single block
- Verifies 64-byte alignment
- Writes to start and end of block
- Verifies patterns are intact
- Frees block and confirms memory clearing

**Validates**: Memory alignment, boundary safety, proper clearing

### 4. Multi-Block Test (`run_multiblock_test`)
**Purpose**: Test contiguous block allocation
**Actions**:
- Allocates 3 contiguous blocks
- Writes patterns across all blocks
- Verifies data integrity across boundaries
- Frees all blocks as a unit

**Validates**: Contiguous allocation, multi-block operations

### 5. Corruption Check (`check_corruption`)
**Purpose**: Detect memory management corruption
**Actions**:
- Scans bitmap for consistency
- Counts allocated blocks
- Compares with internal counters
- Validates bitmap integrity

**Validates**: Internal consistency, bitmap integrity, counter accuracy

## Enhanced System Health Check

The system health check now includes comprehensive memory testing:

```
5. Memory System: Running comprehensive test suite...
   - Basic allocation test: ✓ PASS
   - Memory stress test (50 blocks): ✓ PASS
   - Boundary & alignment test: ✓ PASS
   - Multi-block allocation test: ✓ PASS
   - Memory corruption check: ✓ PASS
   - Memory usage: 0% used, 0% fragmented
   - Largest free block: 4193664 bytes
```

## Comprehensive Test Suite Output

When running the full test suite (`z` command):

```
=== Comprehensive Memory Test Suite ===
Running all memory tests... This may take a moment.

Test 1: Basic allocation/deallocation... ✓ PASSED
Test 2: Memory stress test (50 blocks)... ✓ PASSED
Test 3: Boundary and alignment test... ✓ PASSED
Test 4: Multi-block allocation test... ✓ PASSED
Test 5: Memory corruption check... ✓ PASSED

=== Test Results Summary ===
Tests passed: 5/5
Overall result: ✓ ALL TESTS PASSED
Memory subsystem is fully operational!

Current Memory State:
  Usage: 0% (0 blocks)
  Fragmentation: 0%
  Largest free block: 4193664 bytes
===============================
```

## Test Patterns and Validation

### Data Integrity Patterns
- **Basic Test**: `0xDEADBEEF + index`
- **Stress Test**: `0xABCD0000 + index`, `0x12340000 + index`
- **Boundary Test**: `0x53A47123` (start), `0xE40123` (end)
- **Multi-block**: `0xB10C0000 + index`, `0x12345678`
- **Canary Values**: `0xDEADC0DE` (corruption detection)

### Memory Protection Features
- **Automatic Clearing**: Memory is zeroed on deallocation
- **Canary Protection**: Guard values detect buffer overruns
- **Bitmap Validation**: Ensures allocation tracking integrity
- **Boundary Checking**: Validates all address ranges

## Performance Characteristics

### Test Execution Times (approximate)
- Basic Test: ~1ms
- Stress Test: ~10ms (50 allocations)
- Boundary Test: ~2ms
- Multi-block Test: ~3ms
- Corruption Check: ~5ms (scans entire bitmap)

### Memory Overhead
- Test data patterns: Temporary (cleared after test)
- Canary values: 8 bytes per allocation
- Bitmap scanning: No additional memory required

## Failure Detection

The test suite can detect:
- **Allocation Failures**: Out of memory conditions
- **Data Corruption**: Modified memory contents
- **Double Free**: Attempting to free already-free blocks
- **Invalid Addresses**: Out-of-range memory access
- **Bitmap Corruption**: Inconsistent allocation tracking
- **Alignment Issues**: Improperly aligned allocations
- **Memory Leaks**: Blocks not properly freed

## Integration with System Health

Memory tests are integrated into the system health check (`c` command):
- Automatic execution during startup validation
- Part of comprehensive system diagnostics
- Real-time status reporting
- Integration with other subsystem tests

## Testing Best Practices

### Regular Testing
- Run basic test (`x`) for quick validation
- Use comprehensive suite (`z`) for thorough checking
- Include in health check (`c`) for system validation

### Debugging Memory Issues
1. Check memory statistics (`m`) first
2. Run corruption check (`g`) if issues suspected
3. Use comprehensive suite (`z`) for detailed analysis
4. Monitor fragmentation levels
5. Use defragmentation (`r`) if needed

## Future Enhancements

Planned memory testing improvements:
- **Race Condition Testing**: Multi-core synchronization
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Allocation speed testing
- **Memory Pressure Testing**: Low-memory scenarios
- **Endurance Testing**: Long-running allocation cycles
- **Security Testing**: Buffer overflow detection

The memory testing suite provides comprehensive validation of TinyOS's memory management system, ensuring reliability and correctness in all operating conditions.
