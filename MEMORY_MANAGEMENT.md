# TinyOS Enhanced Memory Management

## Overview

TinyOS now features a sophisticated memory management system with bitmap-based allocation, corruption detection, defragmentation, and comprehensive debugging tools.

## Memory Architecture

### Layout
- **Kernel Space**: 0x80000 - 0x100000 (512KB)
- **Heap Space**: 0x100000 - 0x500000 (4MB)
- **Block Size**: 64 bytes
- **Total Blocks**: 65,536 blocks
- **Bitmap**: Located at heap start, manages block allocation

### Features

#### 1. **Block Allocation**
- Fixed-size 64-byte blocks for simplicity and performance
- Bitmap-based allocation tracking
- Contiguous block allocation support
- Fast allocation with free block hints

#### 2. **Memory Protection**
- Canary values for corruption detection
- Memory clearing on deallocation
- Bitmap integrity checking
- Allocation/deallocation validation

#### 3. **Debugging & Diagnostics**
- Comprehensive memory statistics
- Fragmentation analysis
- Corruption detection
- Memory test suite
- Real-time allocation tracking

#### 4. **Advanced Features**
- Defragmentation support
- Aligned allocation
- Multiple block allocation
- Performance optimization

## Shell Commands

### Basic Memory Commands
- **m/M** - Show detailed memory statistics
- **a/A** - Allocate a memory block
- **f/F** - Free the last allocated block
- **x/X** - Run comprehensive memory test

### Advanced Memory Commands

- **r/R** - Defragment memory and show results

### System Commands
- **c/C** - Full system health check (includes memory tests)
- **h/H** - Show help menu

## Memory Statistics

The system provides detailed statistics including:

```

========================
```

## Implementation Details

### Bitmap Management
- 1 bit per block (8192 bytes for 65536 blocks)
- Efficient bit manipulation for allocation/deallocation
- Atomic operations for thread safety (future)

### Allocation Algorithm
1. Search for contiguous free blocks
2. Mark blocks as allocated in bitmap
3. Add canary values for debugging
4. Return block address
5. Update allocation counters

### Deallocation Process
1. Validate address range
2. Check canary integrity
3. Clear block contents
4. Mark blocks as free in bitmap
5. Update free block hints

### Corruption Detection
- Canary values at block boundaries
- Bitmap consistency checking
- Allocation counter validation
- Memory pattern verification

## Performance Characteristics

- **Allocation**: O(n) worst case, O(1) average with hints
- **Deallocation**: O(1)
- **Fragmentation**: Tracked and reported
- **Memory Overhead**: ~0.2% (bitmap storage)

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Basic Allocation Test**: Allocate/free cycles
2. **Corruption Test**: Verify data integrity
3. **Fragmentation Test**: Monitor memory layout
4. **Stress Test**: Multiple allocation patterns
5. **Health Check**: Full system verification

## Future Enhancements

- Variable-size allocation pools
- Garbage collection
- Virtual memory support
- Multi-core synchronization
- DMA-coherent allocation
- Memory pressure handling

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the kernel
cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-none --release

# Run in QEMU
./run.sh

# Test enhanced memory features
./test_enhanced_memory.sh
```

## Code Structure

- `src/memory.rs` - Core memory management implementation
- `src/main.rs` - Shell integration and command handling
- Memory commands integrated into interactive shell
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting

This memory management system provides a solid foundation for a bare-metal operating system, with room for future enhancements as TinyOS evolves.
