# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## Overview

This document captures the key architectural decisions made during TinyOS development, providing context for why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives.

## ADR-001: Docker-based Development Environment

### Status: Accepted

### Context

TinyOS is a bare-metal operating system targeting ARM64 architecture with specific toolchain requirements. Development environment consistency across different host systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) was challenging.

### Decision

Adopted a Docker-based development environment with standardized `make` commands for all development tasks.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent development environment across all platforms
- Simplified onboarding for new developers
- Isolated build environment prevents host system conflicts
- CI/CD pipeline identical to local development
- Easy toolchain version management

**Negative:**
- Requires Docker installation
- Slight performance overhead for builds
- Additional complexity for debugging low-level code

### Alternatives Considered

- Native toolchain installation per platform
- Vagrant-based virtual machine approach
- GitHub Codespaces only

## ADR-002: Thread-Safe Architecture with Mutex

### Status: Accepted

### Context

Initial implementation used `static mut` declarations for global state, which generated compiler warnings and posed safety risks in a multi-threaded environment.

### Decision

Replaced all `static mut` with `spin::Mutex<T>` for thread-safe global state management.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Eliminated all static mut compiler warnings
- Thread-safe architecture ready for future multi-core support
- Clear ownership and access patterns
- Rust's type system enforces safe access

**Negative:**
- Slight performance overhead for mutex operations
- Additional complexity in accessing global state
- Potential for deadlocks if not carefully managed

### Alternatives Considered

- Keeping `static mut` with unsafe blocks
- Using `RefCell` for interior mutability
- Moving to purely functional architecture

## ADR-003: Modular Shell Architecture

### Status: Accepted

### Context

The interactive shell needed to support many different commands while maintaining clean code organization and extensibility.

### Decision

Implemented a modular command system where each command category is a separate module with its own handler functions.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to add new commands
- Testable individual command modules
- Clear code organization
- Consistent command interface

**Negative:**
- More complex build system
- Potential for code duplication across modules
- Requires careful module dependency management

### Alternatives Considered

- Monolithic command handler with switch statement
- Plugin-based architecture with dynamic loading
- Scripting language integration

## ADR-004: No Standard Library (no_std) Approach

### Status: Accepted

### Context

TinyOS is a bare-metal operating system that needs to run without an underlying OS, requiring careful control over system resources.

### Decision

Used `#![no_std]` throughout the codebase with custom implementations of required functionality.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete control over system resources
- No hidden allocations or dependencies
- Predictable memory usage
- Suitable for embedded/bare-metal environment
- Educational value in understanding OS fundamentals

**Negative:**
- Cannot use standard library conveniences
- More complex error handling
- Custom implementations required for common functionality
- Steeper learning curve for contributors

### Alternatives Considered

- Using std with custom OS targets
- Minimal std subset approach
- Hybrid approach with conditional compilation

## ADR-005: Advanced Memory Management Design

### Status: Accepted

### Context

TinyOS needed sophisticated memory management including virtual memory, page tables, and advanced features like COW and ASLR.

### Decision

Implemented a layered memory management system with separate managers for different concerns:
- Page Manager: Low-level page table management
- Protection Manager: Security features (ASLR, CFI, stack protection)
- User Space Manager: Process memory isolation
- Allocator: Dynamic memory allocation

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clean separation of memory management concerns
- Extensible architecture for new features
- Comprehensive memory protection
- Educational demonstration of OS memory management
- Performance optimizations possible per layer

**Negative:**
- Complex interactions between layers
- Potential for subtle bugs in memory management
- Higher memory overhead for management structures
- Challenging to debug memory-related issues

### Alternatives Considered

- Monolithic memory manager
- Simple paging without advanced features
- Third-party memory management library

## ADR-006: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

### Status: Accepted

### Context

Operating system code is critical and errors can cause system instability or security vulnerabilities.

### Decision

Implemented multi-layered testing approach:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- System tests for full OS validation
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- High confidence in code correctness
- Regression prevention
- Documentation of expected behavior
- Easier refactoring with test safety net
- Professional development practices

**Negative:**
- Significant time investment in test development
- Test maintenance overhead
- Potential for over-testing simple components
- CI/CD pipeline complexity

### Alternatives Considered

- Manual testing only
- Minimal unit testing
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing only

## ADR-007: Error Handling Strategy

### Status: Accepted

### Context

Operating system code must handle errors gracefully to maintain system stability and provide useful feedback to users.

### Decision

Implemented comprehensive error handling using:
- Custom error types for different subsystems
- Result-based error propagation
- Graceful degradation where possible
- User-friendly error messages in shell

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Robust error handling prevents system crashes
- Clear error propagation paths
- User-friendly error messages
- Debuggable error conditions
- Rust's type system enforces error handling

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity in every function
- Potential for error handling bloat
- Performance overhead for error checking
- Requires careful error message maintenance

### Alternatives Considered

- Panic-based error handling
- Global error state
- Minimal error handling

## ADR-008: CI/CD Pipeline Design

### Status: Accepted

### Context

Professional OS development requires automated testing, quality checks, and deployment processes.

### Decision

Implemented comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with:
- Multiple workflow types (CI, PR, feature, dependencies)
- Docker-based builds matching development environment
- Automated testing and code quality checks
- Flexible linting (strict for development, permissive for CI)

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent quality across all contributions
- Automated testing prevents regressions
- Professional development workflow
- Easy integration with GitHub
- Scalable for team development

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity in project setup
- CI/CD maintenance overhead
- Potential for pipeline failures blocking development
- Learning curve for contributors

### Alternatives Considered

- Manual testing and deployment
- Minimal CI with basic build checks
- Third-party CI/CD services

## Decision Process

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Making a significant architectural decision
- Choosing between multiple viable alternatives
- Establishing patterns that will be used throughout the codebase
- Making decisions that will be difficult to change later
