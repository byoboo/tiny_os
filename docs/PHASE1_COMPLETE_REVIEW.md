3. **Build verification**: Test compilation after each major change
4. **Helper function isolation**: Extract common utilities to prevent duplication

### Technical Insights
- **Module size optimization**: Target <500 lines per module for optimal maintainability
- **Clear boundaries**: Functional separation prevents module interdependencies
- **Re-export strategy**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- **Helper duplication**: Acceptable when it maintains module independence

### Process Improvements
- **Continuous validation**: Build and test after each extraction step
- **Documentation first**: Clear module documentation guides implementation
