# TinyOS Phase 4.4 Implementation Plan
# Advanced Memory Features

## Overview
Phase 4.4 builds upon the solid foundation of Phase 4.3 (Stack Management) to implement advanced memory management features including copy-on-write (COW), user space page tables, and dynamic memory protection.

## Phase 4.4 Features

### 1. Copy-on-Write (COW) Implementation
**Priority: High**
- COW page tracking and metadata
- COW fault handling in page fault exception handler
- Page duplication on write access
- Memory sharing between processes/stacks
- COW statistics and monitoring

### 2. User Space Page Table Management
**Priority: High**
- Per-process page table isolation
- User space virtual memory management
- Context switching with page table switching
- Process memory space isolation
- Address space layout randomization (ASLR) foundation

### 3. Advanced Memory Protection
**Priority: Medium**
- Fine-grained page permissions (NX bit, write protection)
- Memory access control lists
- Stack execution prevention (DEP/NX)
- Return-oriented programming (ROP) protection
- Memory tagging and validation

### 4. Dynamic Memory Management
**Priority: Medium**
- Dynamic stack resizing with automatic growth
- Lazy page allocation and decommitting
- Memory pressure handling
- Garbage collection hooks
- Memory compaction support

### 5. Performance Optimizations
**Priority: Low**
- TLB management optimization
- Cache-conscious memory allocation
- Memory prefetching hints
- NUMA-aware allocation (future Pi support)
- Memory access pattern analysis

## Technical Architecture

### COW System Design
```rust
pub struct CowPage {
    physical_addr: u64,
    ref_count: usize,
    is_cow: bool,
    original_permissions: PagePermissions,
}

pub struct CowManager {
    cow_pages: HashMap<u64, CowPage>,
    statistics: CowStatistics,
}
```

### User Space Page Tables
```rust
pub struct ProcessPageTable {
    process_id: usize,
    l0_table_addr: u64,
    user_heap_start: u64,
    user_heap_end: u64,
    user_stack_start: u64,
    user_stack_end: u64,
}

pub struct PageTableManager {
    process_tables: [Option<ProcessPageTable>; MAX_PROCESSES],
    current_process: Option<usize>,
}
```

### Advanced Protection
```rust
pub struct MemoryProtectionFlags {
    readable: bool,
    writable: bool,
    executable: bool,
    user_accessible: bool,
    copy_on_write: bool,
    no_cache: bool,
    device_memory: bool,
}

pub struct ProtectionManager {
    global_policies: Vec<MemoryPolicy>,
    process_policies: HashMap<usize, Vec<MemoryPolicy>>,
}
```
