# Phase 4.3: Stack Management and Protection - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 4.3 builds upon the solid virtual memory foundation established in Phase 4.2 to implement advanced stack management, protection mechanisms, and copy-on-write functionality.

## 🎯 Goals

### 1. Stack Management Framework
- **Stack Allocation**: Dynamic stack allocation with guard pages
- **Stack Switching**: EL0/EL1 stack switching for privilege level changes
- **Stack Overflow Protection**: Hardware-based detection with guard pages
- **Stack Growth Management**: Automatic stack expansion with limits

### 2. Copy-on-Write Implementation
- **COW Page Tracking**: Page reference counting and COW bit management
- **COW Fault Handling**: Page fault resolution for COW scenarios
- **Memory Optimization**: Shared memory with lazy allocation
- **Process Fork Support**: Foundation for process creation

### 3. Advanced Memory Protection
- **Page Protection Flags**: Read/Write/Execute permissions per page
- **User Space Isolation**: Enhanced user/kernel separation
- **Memory Access Control**: Fine-grained permission enforcement
- **Security Boundaries**: Prevent unauthorized memory access

### 4. User Space Page Table Management
- **Per-Process Page Tables**: Isolated address spaces
- **Page Table Creation**: Dynamic page table allocation
- **Context Switching**: Page table switching during process switches
- **Memory Mapping**: User-space memory region management

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Stack Management Architecture
```
Stack Layout:
[Guard Page] [Stack Data] [Guard Page]
     |            |            |
   Protected    Growing      Protected
   (No Access)   Stack      (No Access)
```

### Copy-on-Write Flow
```
1. Page marked as COW (read-only, reference count > 1)
2. Write attempt triggers page fault
3. COW handler duplicates page
4. Updates page table with writable copy
5. Returns to user code with write permission
```

### Memory Protection Levels
- **No Access**: Guard pages, unmapped regions
- **Read-Only**: Code segments, COW pages
- **Read-Write**: Data segments, heap, stack
- **Execute**: Code segments only
