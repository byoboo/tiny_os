# TinyOS CI/CD Release Pipeline Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete CI/CD pipeline setup for TinyOS, focusing on the automated release system for development and production branches.

## Release Strategy

### Development Releases (dev branch)
- **Target**: `dev` branch
- **Triggers**: 
  - Push events to `dev` branch (immediate)
  - Weekly schedule (every Monday at 10 AM UTC)
- **Version Format**: `0.2.0-dev.{build_number}`
- **Tag Format**: 
  - Push releases: `dev-v0.2.0-dev.{build_number}`
  - Scheduled releases: `dev-weekly-v0.2.0-dev.{build_number}`
- **Release Type**: Pre-release
- **Artifacts**: `kernel8.img`, `tiny_os` binary

### Production Releases (master branch)
- **Target**: `master` branch
- **Triggers**: Push events to `master` branch (immediate)
- **Version Format**: `0.2.0` (from Cargo.toml)
- **Tag Format**: `production-v{version}`
- **Release Type**: Full release
- **Artifacts**: `kernel8.img`, `tiny_os` binary

## CI/CD Pipeline Jobs

### 1. Build and Test Job
- **Name**: `build-and-test`
- **Runs on**: All pushes and PRs to `master` and `dev`
- **Dependencies**: None (base job)
- **Actions**:
  - Checkout code with full history
  - Setup Rust nightly toolchain with aarch64-unknown-none target
  - Install QEMU for testing
  - Cache cargo registry, index, and build artifacts
  - Run code formatting checks (`cargo fmt`)
  - Run clippy linting (`cargo clippy`)
  - Build debug and release versions
  - Run comprehensive test suite (`test_tinyos.sh`)
  - Run modular tests
  - Test QEMU boot functionality
  - Generate kernel binary (`build.sh`)
  - Upload build artifacts

### 2. Development Release Job
- **Name**: `dev-release`
- **Runs on**: Push to `dev` OR scheduled trigger
- **Dependencies**: `build-and-test`
- **Actions**:
  - Checkout code (with proper branch handling for scheduled builds)
  - Setup Rust toolchain
  - Install QEMU
  - Run additional tests for scheduled builds
  - Calculate build number from git commit count
  - Determine release type (push vs scheduled)
  - Update version in Cargo.toml
  - Build release version
  - Create GitHub release with appropriate tag

### 3. Production Release Job
- **Name**: `production-release`
- **Runs on**: Push to `master` only
- **Dependencies**: `build-and-test`
- **Actions**:
  - Checkout code with full history
  - Setup Rust toolchain
  - Install QEMU
  - Extract version from Cargo.toml
  - Build production release
  - Create GitHub release with production tag

### 4. Security Scan Job
- **Name**: `security-scan`
- **Runs on**: All push events
- **Dependencies**: `build-and-test`
- **Actions**:
  - Run cargo audit for security vulnerabilities
  - Check for outdated dependencies

## Release Artifacts

### Development Releases
- **Files**: `kernel8.img`, `tiny_os` binary
- **Description**: Pre-release builds for testing and development
- **Installation**: Copy `kernel8.img` to SD card with Pi firmware

### Production Releases
- **Files**: `kernel8.img`, `tiny_os` binary
- **Description**: Stable, production-ready builds
- **Installation**: Copy `kernel8.img` to SD card with Pi firmware

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning
- **Development**: `0.2.0-dev.{build_number}`
- **Production**: `0.2.0` (manual version in Cargo.toml)

### Build Numbers
- Calculated from git commit count on respective branches
- Provides unique, incrementing build identifiers
- Used for both immediate and scheduled releases

## Schedule Configuration

### Weekly Development Releases
- **Frequency**: Every Monday at 10 AM UTC
- **Cron**: `0 10 * * 1`
- **Branch**: `dev`
- **Additional Testing**: Runs full test suite before release

## Tag Strategy

### Development Tags
- **Push releases**: `dev-v0.2.0-dev.{build}`
- **Scheduled releases**: `dev-weekly-v0.2.0-dev.{build}`
- **Purpose**: Distinguish between immediate and scheduled dev releases

### Production Tags
- **Format**: `production-v{version}`
- **Example**: `production-v0.2.0`
- **Purpose**: Clear production release identification

## Release Notes

### Development Releases
- Build information (branch, commit, build number, release type)
- Latest development features summary
- Installation instructions
- Pre-release warnings

### Production Releases
- Version and release information
- Complete feature list
- Installation instructions
- Documentation links
- Production-ready certification

## Testing Integration

### Pre-Release Testing
- All releases require successful completion of `build-and-test` job
- Comprehensive test suite execution
- QEMU boot validation
- Modular test verification

### Scheduled Release Testing
- Additional test runs for weekly scheduled releases
- Full integration test suite
- Comprehensive validation before release

## Security and Maintenance

### Security Scanning
- Automated vulnerability scanning with cargo-audit
- Dependency freshness checks
- Runs on all push events

### Caching Strategy
- Cargo registry caching
- Cargo index caching
- Build artifact caching
- Improves build performance and reliability

## Branch Protection

### Workflow Triggers
- **Push**: `master`, `dev` branches
- **PR**: `master`, `dev` branches
- **Schedule**: Weekly dev releases

### Access Control
- Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` for releases
- Proper branch-based conditionals
- Secure artifact handling

## Monitoring and Artifacts

### Build Artifacts
- Retention: 30 days for test results
- Automatic upload/download between jobs
- Includes kernel binaries and test logs

### Release Artifacts
- Permanent storage in GitHub Releases
- Tagged with appropriate version identifiers
- Includes both debug and release binaries

## Usage Instructions

### For Development
1. Push to `dev` branch → Immediate dev release
2. Wait for Monday 10 AM UTC → Weekly scheduled dev release
3. Use pre-release builds for testing

### For Production
1. Push to `master` branch → Immediate production release
2. Use production builds for deployment
3. Follow semantic versioning in Cargo.toml

## Maintenance

### Version Updates
- Update version in `Cargo.toml` for production releases
- Development versions are automatically calculated
- Use `scripts/version.sh` for manual version management

### Schedule Changes
- Modify cron expression in workflow file
- Consider timezone implications (UTC)
- Test schedule changes carefully

## Next Steps

1. **Test the pipeline**: Push to `dev` branch to verify dev releases
2. **Validate scheduling**: Wait for Monday 10 AM UTC to test weekly releases
3. **Production deployment**: Push to `master` for production release
4. **Monitor releases**: Check GitHub Releases page for proper tagging
5. **Update documentation**: Keep release notes and installation guides current

## Files Modified
