# TinyOS Testing Strategy Post-Refactor

## Current State (After Phase 1 Refactor)

TinyOS has been successfully refactored to a pure `no_std` embedded environment. As part of this process, testing infrastructure has been reorganized:

### Testing Infrastructure Changes

**Removed Components:**
- `tests/` directory integration tests (std-based)
- `src/tests/` directory embedded tests (std-based)
- `src/shell_tests.rs` (std-based)

These have been moved to `archived_tests/` for future reference.

**Current Testing Approach:**
- **Hardware-in-the-loop testing**: Use the shell test suites (`test_*.sh` scripts)
- **Manual testing**: Interactive shell commands for validation
- **QEMU-based testing**: Boot tests and basic functionality validation

### Available Test Scripts

The following shell-based test scripts remain functional:

```bash
# Hardware test suites
./tests/test_hardware_suite.sh
./tests/test_memory_suite.sh  
./tests/test_interrupt_suite.sh

# Automated hardware tests
./tests/test_hardware_automated.sh
./tests/test_memory_automated.sh
./tests/test_interrupt_automated.sh

# Boot and validation tests
./tests/test_qemu_boot.sh
./tests/validate_tinyos.sh

# Shell refactor validation
./tests/test_shell_refactor.sh
```

### Interactive Testing

The modular shell system provides comprehensive interactive testing:

**System Commands:**
- `h` - Help and command listing
- `s` - System information
- `t` - Current system time
- `c` - Health check

**Hardware Testing:**
- `l` - LED toggle/control
- `i` - Interrupt status
- `e` - Interrupt enable/disable
- `j` - Interrupt testing
- `v` - Exception statistics
- `w` - Exception testing

**Memory Testing:**
- `m` - Memory statistics
- `a` - Memory allocation test
- `f` - Memory free test
- `x` - Basic memory test
- `z` - Comprehensive memory test
- `g` - Memory corruption check
- `r` - Memory defragmentation

**Storage Testing:**
- `p` - SD card information
- `q` - SD card read test
- `y` - SD card write test
- `d` - Directory listing
- `n` - Filesystem mount info

### Why This Approach?

**Benefits of the current testing strategy:**
1. **True bare-metal testing**: Tests run on actual hardware or accurate emulation
2. **Real-world validation**: Tests actual system behavior, not mocked components
3. **Interactive debugging**: Shell provides immediate feedback and debugging capability
4. **Hardware verification**: Validates actual hardware interfaces and timing
5. **No test overhead**: No test framework overhead in the final binary

**Future Testing Considerations:**
- Custom `no_std` test framework could be developed if needed
- Hardware-in-the-loop automation could be expanded
- Integration with embedded testing frameworks (like `defmt-test`) could be explored

## Usage

To test the system:

1. **Build the system:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-none
   ```

2. **Run automated test suites:**
   ```bash
   ./tests/test_hardware_suite.sh
   ```

3. **Interactive testing:**
   ```bash
   ./run.sh  # Start in QEMU
   # Use shell commands for testing
   ```

4. **Validation:**
   ```bash
   ./tests/validate_tinyos.sh
   ```

This approach ensures that TinyOS is thoroughly tested in its actual deployment environment while maintaining the `no_std` embedded constraints.
